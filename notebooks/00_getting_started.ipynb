This is like setting up RStudio before you can use R.\n\n**Start here** - this notebook will get you ready to learn Python.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:\n- Install Python and uv (the package manager)\n- Navigate your computer using the terminal\n- Understand what virtual environments are\n- Run Python in different ways (REPL, scripts, notebooks)"

Installing Python & uv\n\nIf you don't have Python installed yet, let's fix that first!\n\n### Step 1: Install uv (it will install Python for you!)\n\n`uv` is a modern Python package manager that makes everything easier. The best part: **it can install Python for you**.\n\n**Mac/Linux** - open Terminal and run:\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n**Windows** - open PowerShell and run:\n```powershell\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n```\n\n**After installing, close and reopen your terminal!**\n\n### Step 2: Verify installation\n\nRun these commands to make sure everything works:\n\n```bash\nuv --version\n```\n\nIf uv is installed, it will show the version number.\n\n### Step 3: Install Python (if needed)\n\nuv can install Python for you:\n```bash\nuv python install 3.12\n```\n\nOr check if Python is already installed:\n```bash\npython3 --version\n```\n\nYou should see `Python 3.11.x` or higher.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **\"command not found\"**: Make sure you restarted your terminal after installing uv\n- **Permission errors on Mac**: You may need to run `xcode-select --install` first\n- **Still stuck?**: Ask Claude Code for help - describe what error you're seeing",
